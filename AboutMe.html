                <p>
                Hi. My name is Andy Mauvais and this is what you should know about me.<br><br>	Currently, I am in my first year enrolled in Florida Gulf Coast Univeristy pursuing a major in Computer Information Systems with a minor in Statistics. One of my goals is to become a data scientist or be in a similar occupation.<br> I was born and raised in Fort Myers, Florida and am of Haitian descent. My passion for technology was developed back in high school (Dunbar High School). There, I was enrolled in many different technology classes that really helped build a foundation for who I am today.<br> Most people that meet me can agree that I am a very mellow and easy-going person, so it is easy for me to get along well with others.<br>    Some miscallaneous things to add about me are that I am a music and basketball enthusiast. My favorite artists include J. Cole, A Boogie, Drake, but of course my taste in music does extend outside of the hip hop genre. My favorite basketball team would have to be the Boston Celtics since they were one of the first NBA teams I have ever watched on TV. I ran track and wrestled while I was in high school.<br> Some my nerdy interests include playing video games and watching almost all films, shows, cartoons within the DC Universe.<br> Disclaimer: I still do enjoy Marvel movies.
